Description:
This script was developed to enhance the detection of events generated by syslog messages 
from the IDS (Intrusion Detection Service) of the Cisco ASA Firewall.

Disclaimer:
I am not responsible for the execution of these scripts, as they serve as a reference 
for improving detections. I highly recommend reviewing your rules and decoders in a 
test environment before applying them to production.
